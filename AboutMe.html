<p>Hi, my name is Ashley Horne. After graduating with my Bachelor’s degree in game design, I’ve spent the last few months expanding my knowledge of a Frontend Developer. Even if my skill set is centered around C#, I want to expand my horizons. I was excited to learn more about the process of frontend development and even further my skills. I’ve always been passionate about front end development and how it can affect millions of people. I would love the opportunity to bring my expertise, positive attitude, and hardworking nature to any position.</p>

  <div id="fullSail" class="collapse demo greyBox">
    At my time at Full Sail, I had direct training on how to not only design games from scratch, but also plan and execute development cycles. I spent most of my time there working on teams to create projects in an agile environment. I would create integrated puzzles, UI menus, and organized levels.

    After I graduated from Full Sail, I decided to look into web design and development. I learned that game design and web design were similar, so I wanted to learn more. I spent time getting a general approach to coding like JavaScript, as well as familiarizing myself with Google Chrome developer tools. During this time, I have learned HTML5, CSS3, and was currently adding React under my belt.

  My time in college has also given me plenty of applied on experience with working in a real industry environment. And thanks to my curious nature to learn more about web design/development. I was able to find a job at Collabera. During my time there, I was able to work with a multidisciplinary team and gave me an opportunity to learn from senior developers.

  Sadly the company I was working for was affected by the pandemic and had to layoff some of their employees. Even when I was affected by the pandemic and job layoff. I continue my studies, by taking online classes through Fayetteville Technical Community College, Udemy, and Coursera.
